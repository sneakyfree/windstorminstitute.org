The public website for **The Windstorm Institute** — independent research at the intersection of information theory, non-equilibrium thermodynamics, molecular biology, and artificial intelligence.

Live site: [windstorminstitute.org](https://windstorminstitute.org)

## Two research tracks

**Track 1 — The Throughput Basin** (Papers 1–9, complete arc): information-theoretic constraints on serial decoders, from ribosomes to transformers.

**Track 2 — Entropic Bounds in Analog Systems** (Paper 10, newly opened): non-equilibrium thermodynamic bounds applied to BEC analog gravity systems.

## Publishing model

Each scientific paper is published in three surfaces:

1. **Institute repo** — `github.com/Windstorm-Institute/<paper-slug>` — the canonical paper PDF, submission scaffold drafts (arXiv + journal-specific cover material), the article HTML, LICENSE, and supplementary material where applicable.
2. **Labs repo** — `github.com/Windstorm-Labs/<paper-slug>` — experimental code, data, and plots (where the paper is empirical).
3. **This website** — the long-form article (`articles/<paper-slug>.html`), plus arc-node / Track-2 / pub-card entries on the homepage.

**Zenodo DOIs:** Track 1 — all nine papers deposited. Latest concept DOIs: Paper 7 [10.5281/zenodo.19498582](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.19498582) · Paper 8 [10.5281/zenodo.19672827](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.19672827) · Paper 9 [10.5281/zenodo.19672921](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.19672921). Track 2 — Paper 10 DOI pending.
